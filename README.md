</p>

### Add a book

When selecting the add book button from the books page you are directed to a form to input the details of the new title. The form requires the user to input the books title, author, genre, summary and provide an image url before submitting this information to the database. If an invalid image url is given a placeholder image will replace the invalid value.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\add-book-form.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

### book<book_id> (book details)

Each book has it's own unique page containing all it's information, user reviews and controls.

- Delete/Edit book controls

If there is a user in session and that user is either the one that added the current book or the site admin a card containing edit and delete buttons will be displayed at the top of the page.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\book-edit-delete-controls.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

Selecting the delete book button will open a modal asking the user to confirm the books deletion.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\delete-book-confirmation.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

Selecting delete will remove the book and all reviews from the database. Selecting cancel will close the modal.

Selecting Edit book will direct the user to the edit book page. See - [Edit book](#edit-book)

- Book details

The main section of the page contains the books details. This section is similar to the book preview cards but displays the books full description and the name of the user that added the book.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\book-details.PNG" width="700px"/>
</p>

If the current user is **not logged in**, a prompt will render under the book details card directing them to login or register to add a review to the book.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\login-register-prompt.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

If there **is** a user in session and they have **not** previously submitted a review for the current book a prompt will render directing them to add a review. see - [Add a review](#add-a-review)

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\add-review-prompt.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

- Reviews

Reviews are rendered in a series of cards each containing the name of the user that wrote it and the star rating they gave. Clicking on the card causes it to expand and reveal the review in full. Only one card may be open at a time.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-closed.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-open.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

If the user viewing a review is in session and the one who submitted it they will also be presented with options to either delete or edit their review. If the current user is the site admin they will have access to only the delete review control.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-open-with-controls.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-open-admin-controls.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

Selecting the delete review button will open a modal asking the user to confirm the books deletion.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\delete-review-confirmation.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

Selecting delete will remove the review from the database. Selecting cancel will close the modal.

Selecting edit review will direct the user to the edit review page. See - [Edit review](#edit-review)

- Add a review

Clicking the 'Add a review' button from a books details page will open a modal presenting the user with a form to input the details of their review. This form consists of a text box for the body of the review and a 5 star rating selector.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\add-review.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

The star rating selector was adapted from [This code](https://codepen.io/jexordexan/pen/yyYEJa) written by Jordan-Simonds. It is highly tactile, interactive and pleasant to use.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\star-ratings.gif" width="500px"/>
</p>

Submitting the form will update the current book details page and display the new review.

### Edit book

- Selecting to edit a book will direct the user to form identical to the add book form but pre filled with the books current information. The user is free to make any edits they like then re submit the book updating the database.

## Testing

### Bugs

- The intention of this code was to take a list of all books and return an array containing only reviews from those books written by a specific user. In my first iteration of the code some user profiles were producing an 'IndexError: list index out of range'. To test this error I printed the results at each stage and found the cause. This error was due to the assumption in my code that the index I would be referencing to add the books title to the 'user_reviews' array would be the same as the current index of the for reviews loop. This would only be true under very specific conditions and would not produce the desired, consistent effect. To resolve this issue I created a separate value to allow me to store, update, then append the data to the 'user_reviews' array before the end of the loop without relying on the loop index.

original code

```
user_reviews = []
for book in books:
    for i in range(len(book["reviews"])):
        if book["reviews"][i]["author"] == username:
            user_reviews.append(book["reviews"][i])
            user_reviews[i]["book_title"] = book["title"]
```

updated code

```
user_reviews = []
for book in books:
    for i in range(len(book["reviews"])):
        print(book["reviews"][i]["author"])
        if book["reviews"][i]["author"] == username:
            values = book["reviews"][i]
            values["book_title"] = book["title"]
            user_reviews.append(values)
```

- During testing I discovered that logging out was causing a KeyError. Reading the error message I discovered this was due to the server checking for a 'user' key in session directly after removing this key. The logout route was directing to the login page which was checking for a user in session. Searching for a key that did not exist was causing the error. I instead decided to direct a user back to the homepage instead after logging out as it is unlikely for a user to want to log back in directly after having logged out.
  - The function I created to test if a user was logged in or not was also causing a key error when the login route was called with either an incorrect username or password. By placing the session check inside a try except block I was able to return 'False' for any state other than a logged in user resolving the error.
  ```
  def is_logged_in():
  """Return true if user is in session"""
  try:
      if session and session["user"]:
          return True
      return False
  except:
      return False
  ```
