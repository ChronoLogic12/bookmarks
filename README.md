- [Tablet](readme-assets/bookmarks-wireframe-mobile.png)
- [Desktop](readme-assets/bookmarks-wireframe-desktop.png)

### Design

As the focus of this site is the books I chose to use a very simple colour pallet with only one colour. This single action colour makes it easy to identify important aspects of any page and avoids causing visual clutter when placed on a page with multiple book covers of varying colours and styles. The site uses consistent styling of elements throughout to further promote readability. The site uses materializes 12 column grid system to achieve a responsive layout.

## **Features**

### Navigation

The sites navigation section is located at the top of all pages. This section contains the BookMarks brand name and logo as well as the page navigation controls for larger displays

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\nav-desktop.PNG" width="1200px"/>
</p>
or an expandable navigation sidebar for these controls for smaller screens. 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\nav-mobile-sidebar.PNG" width="100px"/>

Flash messages are used across the site to give feedback to users in response to their inputs.

Flash messages are always rendered at the top of the page.

### Book preview cards

Throughout the site book previews are displayed as cards containing the books basic info such as title, author and average rating as well as the books cover art. Preview cards also function as links to that books details page where they can find further details and review for the title. These preview cards are displayed in one or two column grids depending on the users screen size and site section.

The editors pick section of the home page contains short write ups on some of the favorite picks of site editors, encouraging users to check out certain titles and engage with the community. Each write up also contains a preview card to direct the user to the books details page.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Books

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\add-book-form.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

### Book details

Each book has it's own unique page containing all it's information, user reviews and controls.

- Delete/Edit book controls

If there is a user in session and that user is either the one that added the current book or the site admin a card containing edit and delete buttons will be displayed at the top of the page.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\book-edit-delete-controls.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

Selecting the delete book button will open a modal asking the user to confirm the books deletion.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\delete-book-confirmation.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

Selecting delete will remove the book and all reviews from the database. Selecting cancel will close the modal.

Selecting Edit book will direct the user to the edit book page. See - [Edit book](#edit-book)

- Book details

The main section of the page contains the books details. This section is similar to the book preview cards but displays the books full description and the name of the user that added the book.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\book-details.PNG" width="700px"/>
</p>

If the current user is **not logged in**, a prompt will render under the book details card directing them to login or register to add a review to the book.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\login-register-prompt.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

If there **is** a user in session and they have **not** previously submitted a review for the current book a prompt will render directing them to add a review. see - [Add a review](#add-a-review)

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\add-review-prompt.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

- Reviews

Reviews are rendered in a series of cards each containing the name of the user that wrote it and the star rating they gave. Clicking on the card causes it to expand and reveal the review in full. Only one card may be open at a time.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-closed.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-open.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

If the user viewing a review is in session and the one who submitted it they will also be presented with options to either delete or edit their review. If the current user is the site admin they will have access to only the delete review control.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-open-with-controls.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\review-open-admin-controls.PNG" width="600px"/>
</p>

Selecting the delete review button will open a modal asking the user to confirm the books deletion.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\delete-review-confirmation.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

Selecting delete will remove the review from the database. Selecting cancel will close the modal.

Selecting edit review will direct the user to the edit review page. See - [Edit review](#edit-review)

- Add a review

Clicking the 'Add a review' button from a books details page will open a modal presenting the user with a form to input the details of their review. This form consists of a text box for the body of the review and a 5 star rating selector.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\add-review.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

The star rating selector was adapted from [This code](https://codepen.io/jexordexan/pen/yyYEJa) written by Jordan-Simonds. It is highly tactile, interactive and pleasant to use.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\star-ratings.gif" width="500px"/>
</p>

Submitting the form will update the current book details page and display the new review.

</p>

</p>

### Entry

- Login

This page consists of a login form with fields for username and password, a submit button and a section to direct users to the register page if they do not currently have a registered account. Inputs are checked on submission and if they are valid and match a registered user they will be logged in. If the data is invalid/incorrect either a form prompt or flash message will give feedback to the user and direct them to try again.

<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-assets\login.PNG" width="500px"/>
</p>

- Register

The register page is similar in layout to the login page but the main form is to register a new account and the prompt section directs to the login page for already registered users. On submission details are checked against registered users to determine if the given username is unique. If it is unique a new user account will be registered, if it is not, a flash message will be displayed asking the user to pick a different username.
