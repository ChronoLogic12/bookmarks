## **UX design**

### Project Goals

The aim of this project is to produce a website that allows book lovers to rate and review books which they have read and share their thoughts with a wider community. With a average rating system of marks out of 5 a user should be able to tell at a glance the general consensus regarding a given book and have the option to dive deeper into people opinions through access to full written reviews.

## Testing

### Bugs

- The intention of this code was to take a list of all books and return an array containing only reviews from those books written by a specific user. In my first iteration of the code some user profiles were producing an 'IndexError: list index out of range'. To test this error I printed the results at each stage and found the cause. This error was due to the assumption in my code that the index I would be referencing to add the books title to the 'user_reviews' array would be the same as the current index of the for reviews loop. This would only be true under very specific conditions and would not produce the desired, consistent effect. To resolve this issue I created a separate value to allow me to store, update, then append the data to the 'user_reviews' array before the end of the loop without relying on the loop index.

original code

```
user_reviews = []
for book in books:
    for i in range(len(book["reviews"])):
        if book["reviews"][i]["author"] == username:
            user_reviews.append(book["reviews"][i])
            user_reviews[i]["book_title"] = book["title"]
```

updated code

```
user_reviews = []
for book in books:
    for i in range(len(book["reviews"])):
        print(book["reviews"][i]["author"])
        if book["reviews"][i]["author"] == username:
            values = book["reviews"][i]
            values["book_title"] = book["title"]
            user_reviews.append(values)
```

- During testing I discovered that logging out was causing a KeyError. Reading the error message I discovered this was due to the server checking for a 'user' key in session directly after removing this key. The logout route was directing to the login page which was checking for a user in session. Searching for a key that did not exist was causing the error. I instead decided to direct a user back to the homepage instead after logging out as it is unlikely for a user to want to log back in directly after having logged out.
  - The function I created to test if a user was logged in or not was also causing a key error when the login route was called with either an incorrect username or password. By placing the session check inside a try except block I was able to return 'False' for any state other than a logged in user resolving the error.
  ```
  def is_logged_in():
  """Return true if user is in session"""
  try:
      if session and session["user"]:
          return True
      return False
  except:
      return False
  ```
