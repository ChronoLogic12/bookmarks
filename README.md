### Project Goals

The aim of this project is to produce a website that allows book lovers to rate and review books which they have read and share their thoughts with a wider community. With a average rating system of marks out of 5 a user should be able to tell at a glance the general consensus regarding a given book and have the option to dive deeper into people opinions through access to full written reviews.
